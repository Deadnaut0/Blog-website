🌐 **Live site:** https://www.deadnaut.me/

This repository powers **Deadnaut**, a personal cybersecurity field notebook focused on **CTFs, red-team learning, labs, and security experimentation**.

This is not a marketing blog.  
It’s **proof of work**.

## 🧩 Blog vs Writeups

### 📰 Blog
High-level and structured content:
- Learning notes & methodology
- Platform progress (TryHackMe / HTB)
- Achievements & milestones
- Tooling breakdowns

Context, reflection, and long-term tracking.

---

### 🧠 Writeups
Raw signal only:
- CTF challenge writeups
- Competition breakdowns
- Problem → exploit → solution
- Scripts and reusable techniques

If a writeup exists, the challenge was **fully solved**.

---

## 🚩 Challenge Domains

- Cryptography
- Blockchain
- Misc / logic challenges
- Occasional reversing, web, infra

Focused on:
- Clear attack paths
- Tool selection rationale
- Reproducibility
- Transferable red-team thinking

---

## 🏴 Labs & Progress

The **Achievements** section tracks:
- TryHackMe badges
- Hack The Box labs
- Completed rooms & paths

Consistency > hype.

---

## 🛠️ Tooling & Experiments

Includes:
- Custom scripts
- Automation experiments
- Learning-driven security tools

Not everything is polished.  
Everything is intentional.

## ⚙️ Stack
