**Description:**
A series of murders across different cities share one chilling detail: every victim had interacted online with the same anonymous boy shortly before their death.

The police investigation stalled. Leads went cold.

Now, you step in as an independent investigator. Every clue you uncover brings you closer to revealing the killer’s identity.

In each task, your objective is to determine:

- `the location`

- `a two-digit magic number linked to it.`
