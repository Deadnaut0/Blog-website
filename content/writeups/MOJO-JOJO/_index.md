During the **MOJO-JOJO CTF**, I successfully solved challenges across multiple categories, including `Forensics, Binary Exploitation, OSINT, Misc, and Crypto.`

In this section, I document how I approached each challenge, the mistakes I made along the way, and the techniques that ultimately led me to the flags.

`These writeups serve both as a personal knowledge base and as a learning resource for anyone interested in CTFs and practical problem-solving.`

Thanks to the **MOJO-JOJO** team for organizing engaging and educational challenges 🐵🧠
