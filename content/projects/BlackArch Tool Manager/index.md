A **fully interactive, GUI-style terminal launcher** for **BlackArch Linux tools**, built with `bash + fzf`.

Browse **hundreds of BlackArch tools by category**, view **full package descriptions**, **install / uninstall / run tools**, manage **favorites**, and launch tools in **floating terminals** — all without memorizing commands.

> Designed for **Hyprland / Wayland users**, but works on any Arch-based BlackArch setup.

## 📦 Requirements

- **BlackArch Linux** (Arch-based)
- `fzf`

- `kitty` terminal
- `hyprctl` (for floating windows)
- `notify-send`

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo pacman -S fzf kitty libnotify
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x blackarch-tool-manager
```

Run it:

```bash
./blackarchtool-manager
```

**That's it.**  
No arguments. No config needed.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

BlackArch has thousands of tools, but:

- Names are hard to remember
- Categories are fragmented
- Descriptions are rarely read
- Running tools closes terminals
- Favorites don't exist

**This launcher fixes that.**

---

## 🛡 Safety Notes

- Uses `sudo` only when required
- No background services
- No telemetry
- No external APIs
- Fully local & transparent

---

## 🧩 Customization

You can easily:

- Change terminal (`TERM="kitty"`)
- Add/remove categories
- Modify floating window size
- Adjust preview layout

> Script is cleanly structured and modifiable.
