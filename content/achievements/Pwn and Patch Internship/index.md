I’m happy to share that I’ve held a dual role at [Pwn & Patch](https://pwnandpatch.com/), working as both a `Ruby on Rails` developer and a `Cyber Security` intern. During this experience, I contributed to secure **application development**, **vulnerability assessment**, and **hands-on debugging** while strengthening my skills across backend engineering and offensive security practices.
