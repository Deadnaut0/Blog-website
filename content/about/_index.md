## WHOAMI

Hello everyone, I'm `Mazen Elheni`, AKA `Deadnaut`, a Tunisian, 21 yo, Computer Science student at ISSATSO.

I'm a CTF player with `Phr34k$` 🐧 and technical team member at `CyberTrace`.

I mainly play `Cryptography`, but I also dabble in `Reverse Engineering` and `Forensics` challenges.

This blog contains writeups of the challenges I play or author and also my inside thoughts in cybersecurity fields.

## CVEs

No public ones yet 😭

## INTERESTS

Cryptography got boring, so I'm exploring these topics:

- `Penetration testing` (currently studying the **OSCP**)
- `Malware development` (still reading DOCS, haven't started yet)
- `Red teaming`
- `Kernel exploitation` (currently exploring the Linux kernel)
- `Browser exploitation` (very interesting, still noob tho)

## Goals

I aim to contribute to `innovative security projects` and collaborate with like-minded professionals, working to build `secure and resilient digital environments`.
